# Miami Neighborhood Map
An exercise in AJAX, APIs, and frameworks

A map tool to help research a list of addresses in Miami. Locations are pinned to the map, and clicking on locations will open an info window with information on the address's rent, address, bedrooms, and other information, as well as a list of nearby restaurants and grocery stores taken from the foursquare API.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your machine and open the `index.html` in the `build` directory. To alter the address information, update the `locations` array in `ViewModel.js` in the `src` directory then run the default `gulp` task to update `build`.
